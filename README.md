Please, open the config.plist and change the ''showpicker'' line to ''true'' and the ''timeout'' to at least ''3''. You need to change these settings in order to show up verbose mode and boot options in opencore. These settings are set to boot directly to the operating system by default; Keep that in mind, Cheers.
